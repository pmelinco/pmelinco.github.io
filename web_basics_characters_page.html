        <h1 class="CharactersIntro">Dune Characters</h1>
        <p> In order to understand the characters of the Dune universe, it is necessary to understand the major organisations that they fall into.</p>
        <p> The majority of characters in the dune universe belong to at least one larger organisation within the empire, as membership in these organisations is necessary to maintain status and power within the world of dune. Most of these organisations are populated by high status and wealthy families, or are headed/directed by them, as the book is focused on the influential Atreides family. </p>
        <h2 class ="CHOAM"> CHOAM </h2>  
        <p> CHOAM is the major trade organisation in the Dune universe. It has a monopoly on all commerce and trade within the Empire, and it had members from all of the major houses. The majority of the wealth of all of the major houses comes from CHOAM profits from trade throughout the universe. The most sought after resource in the galaxy is ‘spice’ (also referred to as melange), which is used by the Spacing Guild (see below) pilots in order to navigate the universe. Spice is a drug that gives the user mild prescient abilities that are necessary to pilot ships in the universe. It can only be found on the planet Arrakis, a desert planet previously ruled over by House Harkonnen. At the beginning of the first Dune book, the emperor has instructed House Harkonnen to relinquish control of Arrakis to House Atreides, which means that House Atriedes will likely have an exponential increase in wealth through more control over the spice trade.</p>
        <p> CHOAM is heavily inspired by the real world organisation OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) which was formed by Southwest Asian and Latin American Countries during the Cold War. OPEC was formed in 1960 with the goal that these petroleum producing countries could gain collective bargaining power over major nations in the global north and gain better control over the oil market. However, the 1973 Oil Crisis  / Oil Boom proved that the collective bargaining and control of OPEC had developed near monopoly level power over the oil market and could cause significant economic impacts on any countries dependent on petroleum for energy and industry. This is what is represented by CHOAM in the Dune universe, due to the heavy reliance on melange for all travel and movement within the universe (see The Spacing Guild for more information). </p>       
        <h2 class="Spacing Guild"> Spacing Guild</h2>  
        <p> The Spacing Guild is the organisation in the Dune universe that controls all movement and travel within the empire. It has a monopoly over space travel and must approve any and all movement within the empire, no matter the affiliation of the travellers. The Spacing Guild moves all resources within the empire through faster-than-light interstellar space travel. This form of travel requires the pilots to use the spice drug for the prescient powers and knowledge it grants to the user. All member pilots in the Spacing Guild undergo rigorous mental and physical training starting in childhood. All member pilots are also addicted to spice, as they are required to use the drug constantly in order to pilot ships for interstellar travel. Because the Spacing Guild controls the movement of all resources in the Imperial galaxies, it is closely connected to CHOAM and maintains the monopoly power of both organisations. During the first Dune book, the Spacing Guild is under the control of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino. </p>
        <h2 class="Lansraad"> Lansraad</h2>
        <p>The Landsraad Council is the council of all the great houses. It is one of the oldest organisations in the Dune universe, since its inception predates the Butlerian Jihad (see the glossary page for more information on the Butlerian Jihad). The council meets regularly with representatives from all of the great houses. There are in total twelve great houses at the start of the first Dune book, but only three of them are major players during the first novel: House Corrino, House Atreides, and House Harkonnen. Some of the other houses, such as House Fenring and House Halleck, have closely allied themselves with other houses in order to increase their influence and power. The purpose of the Landsraad is to maintain equal power of all of the houses throughout the universe and prevent tyranny or dictatorship. The Padishah Emperor holds the title of Emperor but does not hold total power over the empire as was true of historical empires. Instead the Landsraad votes on most major decisions and also maintains control over atomic power. In Dune, the use of atomics by any house is not allowed.</p>
        <p> The Landsraad council does not maintain equality of the houses through checks and balances, instead it is kept through the principle of mutually assured destruction. This relationship and balance of power was heavily influenced by the Cold War politics that were actively ongoing while Herbert was writing the Dune series. The politics of atomic power and nuclear weapons were also a major political point of concern when Herbert was writing the series. The contemporary political situation of the Cold War and tension between the United States and the USSR were major influences in the Dune universe and series. Herbert drew ideas from the impact that these political developments had on southwest Asia during this period. </p>
        <h2 class="BeneGesserit"> Bene Gesserit </h2>
        <p> The Bene Gesserit (ben-Eh JESS-err-it) is an all-women organisation that holds immense political influence and power throughout the entire empire. Each member goes through intensive mental and physical training starting at birth, as women are born into the Bene Gesserit organisation. Women are trained to be able to control their physical biology and psychology to the level of being able to control their own body. It is mentioned that Lady Jessica of House Atreides was able to control the gender of the embryo during her pregnancy with Paul. The Bene Gesserit are also trained to withstand immense pain and distress in order to maintain control over every situation. They are also able to control their speech to a level of being able to convince and control others through commands, using a power called the ‘voice’ which is featured at the beginning of the first novel. </p>
        <p> It is not explicitly explored as much in the first novel, but the Bene Gesserit have very carefully distributed themselves throughout the empire and houses in order to indirectly control the politics and current events of the empire. It is even revealed that they introduced the idea of the ‘Lisan al-Gaib’ and the theology surrounding it to the Fremen in order to put someone in power within the Fremen. The Bene Gesserit are also demonstrated as having an incredible level of patience, demonstrated by their willingness to implement a religious idea among the Fremen that would take generations to come to fruition. Deviating from the Bene Gesserit plan is the worst thing that a member can do as their plan has been carefully curated and planned thousands of years in advance. Acting based on personal interest instead of the communal interest of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood requires these plans to be adjusted and possibly requires hundreds of years to rectify.</p>
        <h2 class="FremenHeading"> Fremen </h2>
        <p> The Fremen are the indigenous people of Arrakis who have figured out how to live in the harsh desert climate of Arrakis, as well as how to manage the sandworms that populate the planet. Many of them despise the Harkonnens for their horrible management and treatment of the planet and its people during their reign. They live in the desert of the planet Arrakis in underground communities. They have also found ways to use the sandworms of the planet for transport, and how to walk in the sand so that the worms won’t be attracted to the rhythm of their steps. </p>
        <h2 class="Mentats"> Mentats </h2>
        <p> After the Butlerian Jihad thinking machines (computers and similar tech) were removed from the empire because of fears of them developing consciousness and abilities past humans. To compensate for the loss of mathematical computing powers, some people are trained in logic starting at birth so that they can carry out high level mathematical and logical computations and problems in their heads almost instantly.</p>
        <h2 class="Sardaukar"> Sardaukar</h2>
        <p> The Sardaukar are the Emperor's infamous militia that are knwon for their fighting skills and brute strength. They are trained from a young age in the harsh climate and setting of the planet Salusa Secundus, and are loyal to only the Emperor and his interests. It is an unspoken truth that the Sardaukar are imprisoned and orphaned children and adolescents who are trained in the prisons of Salusa Secundus in order to build an elite military force for the Emperor to protect himself and his house. They are considered the most formidable fighters and soliders in the empire, though they are taken down easily by Fremen in Dune. </p>
